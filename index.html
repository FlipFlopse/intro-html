    I just wanted to say, How the fuck this kind of shit allowed on this server? May be people have friends and they can joke about Mom and sisters, I do not. Not even among my friends I like these kind of sentences, I know people would call me butt-hurt for not taking this joke but I am not okay with it. I am fully capable of taking any joke, if it is directed towards me. Wtf you have to go to women? This is such a sick mentality!
